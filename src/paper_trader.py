Gabagool Bot - Paper Trader (Simulated Settlement)

Purpose:
    Maintains a simulated wallet and resolves completed dry-run windows.
    Periodically polls Polymarket for market resolution, determines the winner,
    and calculates accurate simulated PnL to track strategy performance
    without risking real capital.
